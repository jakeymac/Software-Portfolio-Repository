# Overview

Hey! My name's Jacob Johnson, and I'm currently studying at Brigham Young University - Idaho, as a computer science major. 
This portfolio will be a sample of my work as a programmer with a few programs and projects of mine.


hello_world.py - This is a simple program that displays hello world! It was created as a simple way to start this portfolio, and greet anyone who comes to take a look!
